# Covid Prevention Model
In this project, I have designed a Database Management System to
organize and store information about a community during the pandemic.
This database contains data about residents, doctors assigned to them,
residents who have tested positive for Covid-19 and whether they have
recovered, and details about resident's vaccinations. It also stores
information about the visitors and whom they are visiting. Through this
project, we can efficiently store and retrieve crucial data that can avoid
community transmission of Covid-19 by swiftly tracking down the source
and isolating it
